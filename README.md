Tcl One Liner is a simple tool that allows to execute simple Tcl
one-liners on the console.

$ ./tol 'puts Hello'

Hello

The -v switch makes tol print result of the following expression.

$ ./tol -v 'expr {1+2}'

3

State is maintained from the evaluation of an argument to the next one...

$ ./tol 'set a 2' 'puts $a'

2

... unless the -r switch is used. This effectively resets the interpreter.

$ ./tol 'set a 2' -r 'puts $a'

Arg 3, line 1: can't read "a": no such variable.
